Welcome to the **Multi-Label Emotion Recognition** project! This repository focuses on detecting multiple emotions from English text using a fine-tuned **BERT** model. We leverage the [GoEmotions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/go_emotions) dataset, which is a large-scale human-annotated dataset of Reddit comments labeled with 27 emotions plus neutral.

## Introduction

In today's world, understanding human emotions from text is crucial for various applications, such as customer service, mental health support, and social media analysis. This project aims to provide a robust solution for detecting multiple emotions in English text. By using a fine-tuned BERT model, we achieve high accuracy and efficiency in emotion recognition.

## Features

- **Multi-Label Detection**: Identify multiple emotions in a single text input.
- **Fine-Tuned BERT Model**: Leverage the power of BERT for natural language processing tasks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Jupyter Notebooks for easy experimentation and visualization.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Clear instructions and explanations for each component of the project.
- **Community Support**: Open for contributions and discussions.

## Installation

To get started with the Multi-Label Emotion Recognition project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanchemtos/Multi-Label-Emotion-Recognition.git
   cd Multi-Label-Emotion-Recognition
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**:
   You can download the GoEmotions dataset directly from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/go_emotions).

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the project by running the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook file `Emotion_Recognition.ipynb` and follow the instructions provided within the notebook to perform emotion recognition tasks.

## Dataset

The project uses the [GoEmotions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/go_emotions) dataset, which contains:

- **27 Emotion Labels**: Includes emotions like joy, anger, sadness, and more.
- **Neutral Category**: Allows for the classification of neutral comments.
- **Large Volume of Data**: Over 58,000 labeled comments from Reddit.

This rich dataset helps train the BERT model effectively, ensuring accurate emotion detection.

## Model Training

Training the model involves several steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data. This includes tokenization, normalization, and label encoding.
   
2. **Model Configuration**: Set up the BERT model with appropriate hyperparameters.

3. **Training**: Run the training script to fine-tune the BERT model on the GoEmotions dataset.

4. **Save the Model**: After training, save the model for future inference.

For detailed instructions on training the model, refer to the `train_model.py` script and the accompanying comments.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the model, we use metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted labels to the total labels.
- **F1 Score**: A balance between precision and recall, especially important for multi-label classification.

You can find the evaluation code in `evaluate_model.py`. This script will help you assess the model's performance on a test dataset.
